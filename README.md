# I will leave it in good hands
An application where everyone can return items to trusted institutions

The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone can donate unnecessary items to trusted institutions.

There are many solutions available, but many of them require extra effort or lack confidence. You have to go to verified places, but there is no time/no way to go there, and the containers under the house or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually reach those in need.
